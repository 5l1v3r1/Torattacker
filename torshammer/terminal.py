    A class that can be used to portably generate formatted output to                       a terminal...                                                                       ....
    `TerminalController` defines a set of instance variables whose                          values are initialized to the control sequence necessary to
    perform a given action.  These can be simply included in normal
    output to the terminal:

        >>> term = TerminalController()
        >>> print 'This is '+term.GREEN+'green'+term.NORMAL

    Alternatively, the `render()` method can used, which replaces
    '${action}' with the string required to perform 'action':
                                                                                                >>> term = TerminalController()
        >>> print term.render('This is ${GREEN}green${NORMAL}')

    If the terminal doesn't support a given action, then the value of
    the corresponding instance variable will be set to ''.  As a
    result, the above code will still work on terminals that do not
    support color, except that their output will not be colored.
    Also, this means that you can test whether the terminal supports a
    given action by simply testing the truth value of the
    corresponding instance variable:

        >>> term = TerminalController()
        >>> if term.CLEAR_SCREEN:
        ...     print 'This terminal supports clearning the screen.'

    Finally, if the width and height of the terminal are known, then
    they will be stored in the `COLS` and `LINES` attributes.
